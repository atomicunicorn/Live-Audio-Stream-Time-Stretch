Live-Audio-Stream-Time-Stretch
==============================

A MaxMSP patch which uses a circular buffer (wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) to time-stretch incoming audio either from a pre-recorded file, or from a live input signal (such as a microphone).
This patch requires the odot MAX protocol developed at CNMAT, which can be downloaded here: http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads/odot
